import { cloneVNode } from 'inferno-clone-vnode';

const cloned = cloneVNode(
  vNode,
  [props],
  [...children]
)
```

The resulting element will have the original elementâ€™s props with the new props merged in shallowly. 
New children will replace existing children. key and ref from the original element will be preserved.
